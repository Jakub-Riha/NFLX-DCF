## 📄 Project Description

This repository contains an Excel-based financial model that forecasts Netflix’s revenue, margins, reinvestment needs, and derives intrinsic equity value using unlevered free cash flows and terminal value analysis. The model includes historical financials, forward projections, and scenario-based valuation outputs.

The project was completed independently using public data, and structured in the style of a buy-side analyst’s DCF model. It is designed to be reusable and auditable.
